## 1.0.2: No Moar BSAs

**Released at**: `28.04.2020`

**Info**:

Various people had serious issues with the compressed BSA files that shipped with the initial release of Elder Souls. The primary goal of this release is to revert back to a 'normal' installation to hopefully resolve the problems for those people. Unfortunately this will result in slower load times and significantly more hard drive space utilized by the game.

To ensure that your save file remains useable please perform the following procedure BEFORE you update:

1. Open the DynDOLOD MCM and deactivate the mod
2. Wait for the deactivation message
3. Go into an interior cell
4. Go back into the MCM and ensure that DynDOLOD shows as deactivated
5. Save the game
6. Update Elder Souls
7. Load your game and head outside.
8. DynDOLOD should now initialize itself; if it doesn't then activate it via MCM
9. That's it.
